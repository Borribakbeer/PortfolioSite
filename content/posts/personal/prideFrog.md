# Process

This render was made for a small competition I have with some friends where we all have a certain timeframe to make a render with a certain theme  
> This render has the theme: **Purple Friday**  
  
> I had **1 weeks** to finish this render.

For this render I wanted to make a superhero frog surrounded by pride mushrooms.  
I started by modeling the frog based on the following references:

For the mushrooms I wanted to do something special. I decided to make every mushroom colored like a prideflag and make the shape of the mushroom based on what type of umbrella the flag stands for.
I started with some mushroom & pride flag references:
> {{<figure src="/images/personal/PrideBRMushrooms.png" align=left width=500 title="A collection of mushroom & pride flag references">}}  

The gay & straight, bi & pan and trans & intersex are paired up as similar mushrooms.
For the main mushroom shader I tried to make them look organic and with small lighter bumps on top.

The cape was made by using the magic texture node to add a fabric like look as well as subsurface scattering to make it feel more transparent / thin

This picture shows the scene before i added some animation and polish such as little purple fireflies and the pride text.
