# Process

This render was made for a small competition I have with some friends where we all have a certain timeframe to make a render with a certain theme  
> This render has the theme: **Galaxy**  
  
> I had **2 weeks** to finish this render.

This render I wanted to create an image of the universe from Hazbin Hotel / Helluva boss.
I started by researching the lore of every ring of hell in the series by checking the wiki.
I then listed all of the elements that needed to be part of the galaxy.

### Galaxy Elements
1. Pride
	- Pentagram moon
	- Heaven
2. Wrath
3. Gluttony
4. Greed
	- Coin Moon
5. Lust
6. Envy
7. Sloth

Based on images from the show I then went by every ring in order to create them. 
I started by creating a shadergraph in Blender that could procedurally generate a rocky ring based on some parameters. 
I used this shader for every single ring but edited it a bit for some special features.
I also added some special features like the hexagon shield in Gluttony or the smog in greed.

Lastly I created the pentagram moon from Pride and the coin moon from Greed. I sadly did not have enough time to finish Heaven since that would have needed a lot of detail.
