      <description>For Golf Rush I was researching different ways to point out to players where the golfball is located. One of these experiments was inspired by the way Hogwarts Legacy points you to quests. With a generated curvy line moving towards the goal. It works by inputting some points to generate a simple bezier curve and then placing knots on that simple curve that are offset randomly along the normal. Then finally all the knots are connected by one last bezier curve.</description>
