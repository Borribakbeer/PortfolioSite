# Process

This render was made for a small competition I have with some friends where we all have a certain timeframe to make a render with a certain theme  
> This render has the theme: **Magic**  
  
> I had **1 week** to finish this render.

First I searched for some refrences.  
Then I modeled a simple cauldron.  
After which I spent a while perfecting the shader.  
Lastly I animated the entire thing.

I used this tutorial to make the fluid foam at the edge of objects that are dipped in: [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOXagWeOAv4&t=44s)
