I have made some postprocessing effects in unity using shaders.


# Outline Shader
I created a shader that uses a simple Sobel Operator to judge where outlines should go.
Not only is the main screen texture sampled and outlined. But also the Depth and Normal textures are sampled to make outlines behave in the way you would expect.
The outline is made so that the parts generated by the Depth and Normal textures have more effect then the main texture has.
The outline is also decreased in effect based on distance. This means that faraway objects don't turn into the color of the outline.

# Speedline Shader
To convey Speed I tried to make a screenspace shader that adds a vignette of speedlines that flash in random positions.
This effect was inspired by the anime style to show speed. Eventually I decided to use a particle system to convey speed instead because it fitted the style of [that game](/posts/team/golfrush/) better.
