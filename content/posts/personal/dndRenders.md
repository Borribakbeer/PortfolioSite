These renders where made for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign I wrote. I spent around 1-2 days per Render.

## Render 1 -Blackwood Manor-

This render was made of the mysterious Blackwood manor. First I quickly modeled the trees and the house and then added lighting and fog. I made two versions of this render. One with normal lighting and one with red lighting to convey the creepy nature of the manor. I then edited the images together in GIMP and also applied a collection of filters over the image like the dramatic outline.

## Render 2 -Campsite-

This render shows an abandoned campsite that was abandoned not so long ago since the fire is still burning. Beside the campfire there is a small mysteriously glowing stone. This image was also edited in GIMP after rendering it. I added the same outline as well as a dramatic streaky glow to the mysterious stone.

## Render 3 -The Gateway-

This render shows a laboratorium where a portal to another universe is located. The lighting is made sterile to convey the feeling of an emotionless space.
