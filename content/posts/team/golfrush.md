Golf Rush is a multiplayer golf game that me and a friend
(Jack Tollenaar) are making using Unity where the goal is
to race to your ball in a golfcart and get to the hole the
fastest. I mostly do the art and he mostly does the
programming, we do game design together and we share
some tasks (like bug fixing). We plan our project with
Trello and use a self hosted Perforce Server for version control.
Here are some highlights of what I made.
